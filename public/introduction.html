    <h2 class="doc">About the Style Guide</h2>
    <p class="doc">This Style Guide provides guidelines, code, and best practices for implementing a consistent user interface across the AGL open application suite.</p>
    <h3 class="doc">Sections</h3>
    <p class="doc">The guide is divided into sections based on application components, HTML elements, and design themes. The following sections are currently available:</p>
    <ul id="table-of-contents" class="doc"></ul>

    <h2 class="doc">How to use this Guide</h2>
    <h3 class="doc">Guidelines</h3>
    <p class="doc">Each section provides an overview of the how to use the components in your applications. This includes design rationale, contextual application, design variations, and detailed implementation instructions where needed.</p>
    <p class="doc">Additionally, the guide provides sections on writing semantic, quality code to improve collaboration.</p>
    <h3 class="doc">Code Snippets</h3>
    <p class="doc">Code snippets are provided with most examples. The HTML snippets can be copied and used as a starting point for your application. The CSS snippets are for reference only as the styles will be integrated into <span class="inline-code">common.css.</span> *</p>
    <p class="doc notice">* <small>CSS that has not been integrated into <span class="inline-code">common.css</span> will be noted as such.</small></p>
    <p class="doc">Most code snippets are <span class="inline-code">contenteditable</span> making it easy to select and copy code. However, this means you can inadvertantly edit the snippet. If you do, refreshing the browser will reset any edited snippets.</p>
    <h3 class="doc">Contributing to the Style Guide</h3>
    <p class="doc">The Style Guide is a living document that will evolve as we enhance the application suite. If an addition or edit needs to be made, please use the following guidelines:</p>
    <ul class="doc">
      <li><strong>Collaborate on new design options</strong> with the Graphics Development team to see how new introductions will affect existing applications and benefit the overall user experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Consider whether a new component needs to be a common component.</strong> New components will only be added to common when they are shared by more than one application.</li>
      <li><strong>Provide sketches, mockups and/or code</strong> for new components.</li>
      <li><strong>Get code and design reviews</strong> for new components you're working on.</li>
      <li><strong>Develop new components</strong> in your applications or local branches.</li>
      <li><strong>Submit a Trac ticket</strong> for new component candidates or fixes/changes.</li>
      <li>Contributions will be evaluated and planned for each sprint.</li>
    </ul>
