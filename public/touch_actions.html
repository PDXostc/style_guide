<p><code>touch-action</code> is a CSS property that specifies whether and how touch input can be received by the user. The default value for <code>touch-action</code> is <code>auto</code>. The remaining values are <code>none</code>, <code>pan-x</code>, <code>pan-y</code>, and <code>manipulation</code>.</p>

<p>The issue for DNA:</p>
All elements inherit the <code>touch-action</code> value of <code>auto</code> from the user-agent. Therefore, when an element that has scrolling or zooming behavior (eg. an overflowing list) is touched, <em>all</em> the DOM elements receive the touch behavior. This results in unwanted panning and zooming of the entire application. 

<p>The fix for DNA:</p>
<p>The <code>touch-action</code> property has been set to <code>none</code> across the app via the <code>body</code> element. All the DOM elements will now inherit this value and not have the ability to be scrolled or zoomed. The side-affect is that it disables scrolling of overflowed elements.</p>

<p>To regain scrolling, the <code>touch-action</code> property needs to be reset at the level of the scroll element. The following style rules have been added to <code>common.css</code> to assist in quickly enabling scrolling on any element.</p>
